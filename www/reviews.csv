"B0DBZ1XZR9","B0DBZ76XQH",2024-12-17,5,"Leanne-Sarah","Lovely addition","This rug is the perfect addition to my room! It’s a great size—big enough to anchor the space without overwhelming it. The design and texture are stunning, instantly giving my room more character and warmth. It ties everything together beautifully and makes the space feel so much cozier. The quality is fantastic, and it’s soft underfoot, which is a huge plus. If you’re looking for a rug that’s both stylish and functional, this one is an excellent choice!"

"B0DBZ4NKXJ","B0DBY8NGRN",2024-12-30,5,"RC","Lovely rug","This rug is very lovely. It’s easy to take care of especially having pets and grandkids. It’s still and it’s adjustment stage of laying flat. I bought another one but different for the bedroom. I would highly recommend it, but I will not be washing it in my washing machine they are too heavy."
"B0DBYZTRJS","B0DBZGL9YS",2025-01-02,5,"Laura E","Nice Rug","Love the colors. My dog is happy to have a run to roll all over. 8x10 is huge. Quality looks good, no smell. Softness is perfect. Cordless Dyson has a problem going over it when vacuuming but room a doesn’t have any issue."

"B0DBZ4NKXJ","B0DBYZ1P1H",2025-01-15,4,"Monica Youngling","Colors are more muted than pic shows","Second washable rug I've ordered (different sellers, but same type of rug) and both were more muted in color. The ""green"" one I ordered (showed up as an apple green in the pic) was more like a darker goldy beige."
"B0DBZ1XZR9","B0DBZ76XQH",2025-01-17,4,"A Brown","Nice looking and very soft rug","I use this rug in my family room. The neutral beige color goes with everything. It doesn’t show dirt with the marbled “geometric” pattern. I have a German shepherd who sheds a lot but this rug is easy to clean with the vacuum rug height set to high. It’s very soft underfoot and stays in place. Nice rug at a reasonable cost."
"B0DBZ4NKXJ","B0DBYX9CK6",2025-01-19,5,"Cait","Beautiful!","I love this rug! It’s thin, but sturdy. It’s very soft (like a short fleece blanket). The colors are also beautiful. Highly recommend."

"B0DBVMKVF7","B0DBVN24HV",2025-01-22,1,"Lisa","Color is not consistent some areas look distressed","I purchased the 9X12 in cream and love the color but unfortunately only on half of the rug. The color is not consistent. The rug looks distressed on one half and more vibrant on the other half. It seems like the machine was running out of ink."
"B0DBYZTRJS","B0DBYT5KQ7",2025-01-28,2,"Nati Ramirez","Quality","The carpet in person looks very cheap and the material feels cheap expected WAY better for the price. Also it has a lot of wrinkles."
"B0DBZ4NKXJ","B0DBYXH8YW",2025-01-30,5,"Kimberly Kell","Beautiful","This rug is so soft and beautiful!! It elevates my space. The wrinkles came out in just a few hours from walking on it. It really stays in place. The colors and design are very pretty"
"B0DBVMKVF7","B0DBVM7S5P",2025-02-01,5,"Emily","I love it","Perfect!! Better than expected. Good price. Thin but soft and well made.. and has a thin rubber backing that grips to the floor."
"B0DBZ1XZR9","B0DBYW12W5",2025-02-04,2,"Margaret Morneau","Not easily washable.","It's soft, but NOT really washable. It's hard to get in a regular washer or dryer and doesn't dry well. I've been drying it for 2 days and it's still not dry. Just spend extra money and get a Ruggable rug."
"B0DBZ4NKXJ","B0DBY8NGRN",2025-02-06,5,"Jess_d ","Gorgeous moody rug","Absolutely beautiful. I put this under my camel leather couch and it’s stunning. I have returned other rugs and I am so glad I did because this is the perfect fit."
"B0DBVMKVF7","B0DBVN24HV",2025-02-08,5,"Alyssa Laughlin","Great washable rug!","Very cute thin washable rug"
"B0DBYZTRJS","B0DBYV7V8N",2025-02-12,5,"Ward","Nice understated rug","This rug is really nice looking, understated and light colored to help make my tiny living room feel brighter. The rug is super soft (but not deep/squishy, it's rather thin) and my dogs and my feet love it. I haven't tried cleaning it in my washing machine yet as my two small pups have been accident free since I laid it down--knock on wood. Instructions say to machine wash and then hang dry so keep that in mind, you'll probably destroy a consumer grade dryer trying to tumble dry it. I recommend the rug!"
"B0DBVMKVF7","B0DBVNT5V3",2025-02-12,5,"Amazon Customer","Beautiful rug!","The colors in the rug are beautiful. They are thin however I added a pad for extra comfort. The material is so soft. I can’t believe this is a washable rug. I would highly recommend!"
"B0DBVMKVF7","B0DBVM69Y6",2025-02-13,5,"sweetpea","So soft and the colors look great in my room.","I have been looking for weeks for an 8'x10' rug that would match my living room colors, dark grey, light sage green, white, and tan. Even a little dark blue would be fine. It's hard to tell from pictures, but it looked like the colors in this rug would work. I was skeptical and worried that it would look 'cheap' since it is a printed on design. I decided to give it a try and I was pleasantly surprised! The colors either match or blended in really well to the existing carpet, wall color, baseboards, and sofa. There is not white in it but some of the cream color is very light so it blends in. I needed a light sage color and this worked just fine. There are a variety of green shades in this rug, so I think it would work well with other greens too. It does not look cheap at all and I love the soft feel of the rug under my bare feet and even when I lay/sit on it. The rubber backing is nice. Mine is on carpet with furniture on top of it so I can't speak to how well it stays put on hard flooring, but looks like it would do the job. There is no way I'll be able to put this in my wash machine, though it looks like it will be easy to spot clean."

"B0DBZ4NKXJ","B0DBYVNMF8",2025-02-19,5,"brea wiblemo","Great rug for great price.","Great rug for a great price. It’s super soft. The color is vibrant and true to the advertised pictures. It came folded, but the creases relaxed away after a week. It’s thin enough to wash, but has a thin slip resistant back. It’s mostly natural with no toxic chemicals and off- gassing smells. I’m impressed with the quality for price. I ordered two more for other rooms."

"B0DBZ4NKXJ","2",2025-02-22,5,"Ken Caldwell","Honest review…","As u can tell in the pics I have dark wood living room furniture. When I wanted to buy new couches my husband insisted on dark leather furniture. I really needed to brighten up the room. Bought several different rugs on Amazon only to return trying to the find “the one”. Well I finally found it. This is a 9x12 and I have a large open room. I have no cons at this point but here r my pros. Hope these help if u r on the fence or exasperated as I was trying to find a reasonably priced rug. 1. Arrived folded in a box. My first thought was here we go again with the same deep creases with the previous rugs I returned. Unfolded it and only one center crease that was gone the next day. 2. Soft. Colors vibrant and not muted or distressed. 3. Edges are bound nicely 4. Vacuumed first day it arrived on low pile setting and no issue with the rug getting sucked up or pulling out fibers 4. I have dogs, snow is melting, paws are muddy. Easily cleaned a muddy paw print with a damp wash cloth. No stains or damage to the rug 5. Has multiple colors that work well together with none overwhelming the others. Refer to my pics to see. 6. It is not thick like the expensive rugs but thicker than the other washable rugs. For me, I really do not feel it needs an under pad. 7. Does not have a looped or weaved pile but is more of a somewhat velvety feel which is really nice and feels good under my feet. 8. Has no matting so far. 9. Has not shed 10. With the multiple colors it is versatile for many color pallets 12. Has a rubber like backing that prevents the rug from moving on hardwood and tile. Would be perfect as a door mat or in a bathroom, hallway and kitchen. 13. Excellent price for the quality. I would buy this brand again."

"B0DQ8H7WR8","B0DQ8SFYYM",2025-02-24,2,"J.B.","Disappointed.","Luxrug 6x9 Rug. Well. The pattern is pretty. If you’re looking for an Insta ready rug, this will do. I don’t know why I keep trying rugs from Amazon because they’re not traditional rugs. This one, it’s more like a floor blanket. Seriously, the fibers are like a cheap, thin, fleece blanket with a rubber backing. I am very skeptical about the promises made in the listing. I have two big dogs who shed a lot. I am envisioning blankets with their fur stuck all over and now I have one on my floor. We’ll see how easy it is to vacuum and if it really is stain resistant. Also, it’s supposedly machine washable but I feel that it’s a bit bulky to go into my home washing machine. The listing also says “office” in the title. I’m picturing a rolling chair and I’m not sure it would do well if you had to roll on and off the rug regularly. I had a difficult time getting my rolling island on and off the rug. I basically had to lift the island enough to pull the rug under until it was straight. If you are expecting what this really is, then you’ll likely be very happy. This is not what I expected. I expected a legitimate, knotted, carpet like rug. It’s just not that. To be fair, the listing does state how thin it is (get out your ruler/tape measure so you know what you’re getting yourself into) and it says that it is printed. I should have known. If it can hold up to paws and fur as promised, then I will be surprised and very pleased. Maybe it’ll grow on me."

It goes along nicely with the decor in my room, alongside protecting the rug underneath. I recommend this product to anyone searching for a good-quality area rug !"

"B0DQ8H7WR8","B0DQ8SFYYM",2025-02-26,5,"R Page","Great rug to ground black office furniture and computers in a pastel room.","I picked this rug up to coordinate a black standing desk, computer an peripherals in a pastel room. The rug is low profile, soft, and washable, which makes it easy to maintain. The walls are butter yellow with white trim, and the main colors for soft furnishings in the room are white and sky blue with accents of moss green and ballet pink. All of these colors are in the rug, and it ties the whole room together nicely. A set of black floating corner shelves was all that was required to create a nice flow around the otherwise pastel room."
"B0DBVMKVF7","B0DBVMLB8P",2025-02-26,4,"Scott A. Mandia","Great Area Rug!","Beautiful pattern and brings lightness and beautiful colors to the room. The large rug is taking some time to flatten out so I’m hoping the lumps and bumps and creases come out soon. Great value, soft, and love that it is washable."
"B0DQ8H7WR8","B0DQ8SFYYM",2025-03-01,5,"Donna Jarrell","Great Rug","This rug is exactly what I was looking for to place under my dining room set. It is VERY low pile which is what I wanted. The creases came out very quickly it is super easy to vacuum and looks beautiful! Also, it is super soft. The colors are not bright but are very soft and classy. Not sure how it washes since I just received but am very pleased with this purchase."
